        <em>Nobody’s born smart.</em> We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <em>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</em><br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein couldn’t count to 10.</strong><br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, <em>we are born to learn.</em><br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <strong>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</strong><br>
        Until one day, <em>you walk.</em><br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        <strong>Failing is just another word for growing.</strong> And you keep going.<br>
        <em>This. is. learning.</em><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it.<br>
        <strong>You just don’t get it, yet.</strong> Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that <em>anyone, anywhere can understand.</em><br>
        <strong>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong><em>You can learn anything.</em></strong>
